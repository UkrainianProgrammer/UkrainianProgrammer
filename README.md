I am a Ukrainian software engineer. Feel free to explore my popular repos pinned below.

Currently in progress:

* [ExPI](https://github.com/UkrainianProgrammer/ExPI) - REST API written in TypeScript for logging data. Includes cool stuff like [TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/), [Winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston) & [PM2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/)

Recently completed:

* [Bookstore](https://github.com/UkrainianProgrammer/bookstore) - Bookstore web app based on React, Tailwind CSS, MongoDB, and Node. View, buy, and manage your books. Also, admins get to view website stats using custom dashboards!
